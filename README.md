# Microlearn

Âµlearn will be a website and app that utilizes the MediaWiki Action API to provide daily articles in Wikipedia categories that the user is interested in.

It focuses on applying the concept of microlearning, which is a skill-based approach to learning that delivers information in small, highly focused chunks. The user can create an account and request up to 5 articles per day. They can access the articles all day via their account, then the article queue is reset the next day. This enhances learning in the most efficient and effective manner in subjects that the user cares about.
